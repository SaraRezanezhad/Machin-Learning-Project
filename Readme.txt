Data Privacy in Machine Learning: Machine Unlearning and Membership
Inference Attacks
Conducted comprehensive research on data privacy in machine learning using Python, focusing on machine
unlearning techniques and the implications of membership inference attacks.
â€¢ This project was executed in two phases: the first phase involved the development and implementation of
algorithms to facilitate effective machine unlearning, while the second phase assessed the vulnerabilities of
models to membership inference attacks. Developed innovative strategies to enhance data protection without
compromising model performance, contributing to the ongoing discourse on secure machine learning practices.
